# Final Review

In this repo you will find lecture and SRE summaries from CS120 post-midterm material (still unsure if I'll be able to finish pre-midterm material in time).

# Purpose

The purpose of doing this is to provide easier to understand pseudocode (written as steps rather than actual code) and better conceptual understanding. Please feel free to add any corrections as a pull request.

# Separation Method

Notes are separated into two categories: Lecture Summaries and SRE's. Lecture summaries are grouped by topic, not by lecture (i.e., all graph lectures are in one document). SRE's are individual (one per SRE).
